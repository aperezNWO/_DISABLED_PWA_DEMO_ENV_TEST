Creating a full Towers of Hanoi application in Angular involves multiple components, TypeScript logic, and HTML/CSS styling. Unfortunately, I can't directly demonstrate or execute Angular code within this text interface. However, I can provide a general structure and example code snippets to help you get started.

Let's start with a basic outline:

Component Structure:
AppComponent (main component)
TowerComponent (for displaying each tower)
DiskComponent (representing the disks)
TypeScript Logic (AppComponent or a Service):
Define towers and disks in arrays.

Implement functions to move disks between towers based on the rules of the game.
Check for the winning condition.
HTML Templates:
AppComponent Template (app.component.html):
html
Copy code
<div class="game-container">
  <app-tower [tower]="towerOne"></app-tower>
  <app-tower [tower]="towerTwo"></app-tower>
  <app-tower [tower]="towerThree"></app-tower>
</div>
TowerComponent Template (tower.component.html):
html
Copy code
<div class="tower">
  <div class="disk" *ngFor="let disk of tower">
    <!-- Display disk content here -->
  </div>
</div>
CSS Styling:
Apply CSS to style the towers, disks, and game interface to make it visually appealing and intuitive for users to interact with.

TypeScript Logic (AppComponent or a Service):
Define towers and disks in arrays.
Implement functions to move disks between towers based on the rules of the game.
Check for the winning condition.
This is a basic outline of how you might structure your Angular application for the Towers of Hanoi game. You'll need to flesh out the logic, styling, and interactions within each component and tie them together using TypeScript.

If you need specific code snippets or further guidance on a particular aspect of the application, feel free to ask!
